<h3 class="style1">Configuration files</h3>
<p>
All of the site configuration is now controlled by files in the content\settings folder:
</p>
<ul>
<li>settings.ini - Controls the features and customization of the site</li>
<li>locations.ini - Details on all of the test locations</li>
<li>intro.ini - Introductory paragraph on the main page</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="style1">New Install</h3>
<h4>
Single machine configuration (web server and testers running on the same 
machine):
</h4>
<ul>
<li>You need an XP or 2003 Server or later</li>
<li>URLBlast.exe needs to be added to the startup folder (or for testing, just manually started) – 
It is in the “Web Site” folder root</li>
	<li>Install the Dummynet driver (see below)</li>
	<li>A shortcut to &quot;Web Site\dummynet\ipfw.cmd&quot; needs to be added to the 
	startup folder</li>
<li>Avisynth needs to be installed to support rendering of captured videos</li>
	<li>As far as software goes, you need Apache 2.2+ with PHP 5 installed and mod_rewrite enabled</li>
<li>There is a sample httpd.conf file for Apache in the Web Site folder</li>
	<li>Disk space depends on how much history and volume you’re expecting but the requirements are pretty light – around 250 KB per test run so around 4000 per gig</li>
	<li>Default OS accounts will get created the first time urlblast is run 
	(user1, user2, etc).&nbsp; If you want to override the account names or 
	passwords edit them in urlblast.ini</li>
	<li>The main account you want to use for running the controller software needs to be an admin account and configured to auto login (I use TweakUI to set up the auto login).  Sorry, can’t run locked because the desktop needs to be visible to be able to capture the screen shots).  If your remote system isn’t in a secure location and you don’t trust the remote hands and eyes this is the scariest part since the system will be logged in as an admin all the time (at the console).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiple machine configuration (split web server from testers):</h4>
<h5>Web Server:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The web server can be running any OS that supports Apache 2.2+ and PHP 5 
	(Linux and Windows have been verified to work)</li>
<li>You need Apache 2.2 (or later) installed with mod_rewrite enabled</li>
	<li>You need PHP 5 installed and configured to work with Apache and you need 
	the gd2 plugin enabled</li>
	<li>There is a sample httpd.conf file for Apache in the Web Site folder</li>
	<li>Disk space depends on how much history and volume you’re expecting but the requirements are pretty light – around 250 KB per test run so around 4000 per gig</li>
</ul>
<h5>Test Machine:</h5>
<ul>
<li>You need an XP or 2003 Server or later</li>
	<li>Copy urlblast.exe, urlblast.ini, pagetest.dll and the dummynet folder to a folder on the test 
	machine</li>
<li>URLBlast.exe needs to be added to the startup folder (or for testing, just manually started) – 
It is in the “Web Site” folder root</li>
	<li>Install the Dummynet driver (see below)</li>
	<li>A shortcut to &quot;Web Site\dummynet\ipfw.cmd&quot; needs to be added to the 
	startup folder</li>
	<li>Default OS accounts will get created the first time urlblast is run 
	(user1, user2, etc).&nbsp; If you want to override the account names or 
	passwords edit them in urlblast.ini</li>
	<li>The main account you want to use for running the controller software needs to be an admin account and configured to auto login (I use TweakUI to set up the auto login).  Sorry, can’t run locked because the desktop needs to be visible to be able to capture the screen shots).

</ul>
<h3 class="style1">Upgrade Existing Install</h3>
<p>To upgrade an existing install, copy over the whole content folder except for 
the settings directory.&nbsp; You should also update your pagetest.dll and 
urlblast.exe binaries. and install Avisynth on the test machine.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: With the 1.7 release, the format of the 
locations.ini file has changed.&nbsp; You will need to update your existing 
locations file if you are upgrading from 1.6 or earlier.&nbsp; There are also new settings in settings.ini so make sure 
to copy over any that you wish to enable (of particular interest is probably the 
setting to enable video capture).</p>
<h3 class="style1">Installing Dummynet</h3>
<p>Dummynet is needed for configuring the different forms of connectivity on the 
test machine.&nbsp; To install the driver:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pull up the properties for the NIC that is used to access the Internet
	</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Install&quot; </li>
	<li>Select &quot;Service&quot; and click &quot;Add&quot; </li>
	<li>Click &quot;Have Disk&quot; and navigate to &quot;Web Site\dummynet&quot;</li>
	<li>Select the ipfw+dummynet service (and click through any warnings about 
	the driver being unsigned) </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
